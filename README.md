# StitchIt and CIDRE

This is a fork of the main stream poject [*StitchIt*](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt). In the original code the nonlinear illumination correction is performed by calculating the average image. It is working very well on images with good autoflourescence (e.g. brain sample), however, on spleen images we could find an appropriate background image. In this fork we are integrating CIDRE illumination correction algorithm [CIDRE](https://github.com/Fouga/cidre))
